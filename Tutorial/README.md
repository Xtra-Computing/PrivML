# A Tutorial on Federated Learning Systems: Comparative Studies and Hand-on Demonstrations

This page introduces our tutorial on federated learning systems, which will appear in IJCAI-20. We will update this page with more detailed materials.

## Abstract

Federated learning has become a hot research area in machine learning, which enables multiple parties collaboratively training a model without exchanging the local data. It is attractive to researchers working on many areas such as distributed learning, privacy, and fairness. Meanwhile, many companies have developed their federated learning systems such as [Webank FATE](https://github.com/FederatedAI/FATE) and [Google TensorFlow Federated](https://github.com/tensorflow/federated), which provide useful platforms for researchers.

In this tutorial, we will introduce the concept of federated learning, including current widely used federated learning frameworks. Specifically, we will present comparative studies on existing system from the perspective of data partitioning, machine learning model, scale of federation, communication architectures, privacy mechanisms, and motivation of federations. Moreover, we will present existing federated learning systems and demo the usage of FATE. We will also cover the benchmark study of federated learning systems.
