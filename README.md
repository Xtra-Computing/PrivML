## Overview

This repo summarizes the private machine learning work of Xtra group. Currently we work mainly on two areas: federated learning and differential privacy. Federated learning enables the collaborative learning of multiple parties without exchanging the local data.

## Project Descriptions

We have worked/are working on the following projects.

(1) [Federated Learning Survey](#FL_survey): We conducted a survey on federated learning systems.

(2) [Federated Gradient Boosting Decision Trees](#SimFL): We designed a novel federated learning framework for gradient boosting decision trees.

(3) [Differentially Private Gradient Boosting Decision Trees](#DPBoost): We designed a differentially private gradient boosting decision tree training algorithm.
